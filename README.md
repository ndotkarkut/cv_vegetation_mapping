# React Vegetation Mapper

React Vegetation Mapper is a React-frontend and Node.js / Python-backend web application that uses the Google Maps Javascript API to perform computer vision computations on Google's Street View Imagery.

## Installation

```

### Server 

Use either yarn or npm to install the necessary packages for the Node.js environment
